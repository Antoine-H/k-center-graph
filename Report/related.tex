	%General case
	In their article from 2004, Demetrescu and Italiano present an algorithm
	for the all pairs shortest paths problem. It works with a general graph
	with non-negative real-valued edge weights and supports any sequence of
	operations for an amortized running time of $O(n^2 log^3 n)$ per update.

	%$O(n^2 log n)$ for increase only. Worth mentioning?

	An algorithm maintaining a distance matrix will work in $\Omega(n^2)$ as
	for each update, at most $n^2$ paths are changed. The above algorithm is
	thus essentially optimal.

	In 2017, Abraham, Chechik and Krinninger came up with an algorithm taking a
	directed weighted graph with no unweighted cycles as input, against an
	adaptive online adversary, working in $O(n^{2 + \frac{2}{3}}
	log^{\frac{4}{3}}n)$.

	%Planar case
	Other results for specific classes of graphs exist. In 1995, Henzinger,
	Klein, Rao and Subramanian found a data structure handling planar graphs in
	$O(n^{\frac{9}{7}} log D)$ per operation plus a preprocessing time of
	$O(n^{\frac{10}{7}})$. An operation being a query, an edge deletion an adge
	addition or chanching lenths. $D$ being an upper bound on the sum of the
	absolute-values of the negative edge-lengths.
	%Let G be an n-node planar directed graph G such that the sum of the
	%absolute-values of the negative edge-lengths is at most D. The
	%preprocessing to create the data structure from G is
	%$O(n^{\frac{10}{7}})$. The space required by the data structure is $O(n)$.
	%The time per operation is $O(n^{\frac{9}{7}} log D)$. The time bound for
	%queries, edge-deletion, and changing lengths is worst-case while the time
	%for adding edges is amortized.
